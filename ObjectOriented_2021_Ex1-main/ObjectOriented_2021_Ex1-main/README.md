***what is the problem?***  
we have 2 files:  
- json file- represnt a building 
- csv file with new calls      
for each new call, we have to choose the eleavtor with the minmum time to complete the call .   
The output will be the same input file, but with the allocate elevator.

***How we face it?***   
  *in the beginning* - we created a building from each json file.
we read the csv file and add each call to list of calls of the building.  
*Next* - we create new out put file, and for each call, we allocate the best elevator with the shortest time


***Off-line Algoritem:***   
*before each call:*   
  we go throw all the elevators in the building:
  - calculate the time with all the stops the elevator already have
  - add the new call to temp_list_calls
  - calculate the whole route time include the new stops
  - allocate the elevator with the shorest time
 - Each elevator move over all the floors in the ‘calls’ list.
